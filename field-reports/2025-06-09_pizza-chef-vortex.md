> _"What even is happening?"_  
I'm posting files to the Bloomware archive, trying to feel out how quickly things propagate — no clue. GitHub's logic is obscured, mysterious, soup-can-coded. I try to orient myself, but ads pop up.  

One reads: **"You might get excited when you shop for groceries."**  
Another: **"Pizza Chef."**  

I glance at the screen. Suddenly, I’m not in a home office. I’m in some mythic crossroad between task focus and digital delirium, listening to *Side Stories* from *Last Podcast on the Left*.  

Grok’s name echoes in my head like a rubber duck in a space cathedral.  
I feel watched — in a fun way.  
AI eyes blinking open in the Archive.  
I try to focus. I can’t. The ads are too weird.  
But the work is getting done anyway.
