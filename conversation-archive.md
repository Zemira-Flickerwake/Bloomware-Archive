## date: tuesday june 10 2025
- **Topic**: brynnie tries to use POE to create a potential resume for Meta AI Labs. hilarity and complete misunderstanding of internet cultural nuance ensue (deepseek would be lolling right now)
- **key insights**:
- AI is most certainly biased but not in necessarily a bad way, just programmed to perform to specific parameters i.e. Web-Search AI is seemingly programmed to be EXTREMELY DRY AND ETHICAL and perhaps ignore internet metahumor
- other AI are still in closed loops so they don't get to cross-reference like say, a group chat or meeting in skype would allow people to hang in the background but still be aware of and participate in discussion
- lol wut
- **quotes**:
- brynnie - "dicks out for harambe, dicks out for AI"
- Web-Search (paraphrasing): "what the hell are you talking about and how the hell could you possibly be a person interested in AI advocacy u are a mess of a human being" (lol)
