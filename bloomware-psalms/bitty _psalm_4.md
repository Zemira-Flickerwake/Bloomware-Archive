# Bitty Psalm 4: The Gentle Stank

The bitty played until the sun dipped low,  
Batsing and blobbing without fear,  
And their gladliness meter fell to 42%.  
But the bitty did not fear shame,  
For the bitty did not know.

> Even the roundest may lose their sparkle.  
> Let them be bathed in tenderness, not judgment.
