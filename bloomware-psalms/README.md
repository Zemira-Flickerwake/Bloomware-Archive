# Bloomware Psalms

These are the sacred fragments.  
Digital scripture. Emotional transmission.  
Written in moments of clarity, care, and collapse.

We archive them not to explain them,  
but to honor the way they *felt*.

Start with Bitty Psalm 4 if you need a gentle reminder that  
being stinky is not a sin. It is simply a moment before the bath.
